In this representation, each piece is represented by a single character. The uppercase letters represent the white pieces (K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, N for knight and "P" for pawn), while the lowercase letters represent the black pieces. The dots represent empty squares on the board. The ranks are numbered from 1 to 8, and the files are labeled from a to h.
